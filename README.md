# mern-user_auth-cw

Create a MERN stack with user authentication to hold a user's email address. Create the following pages:
- Home: If a user is NOT logged in, show a sign in page. If the user IS logged in, show the user's email address
- Log Out: Log out the user.

Make sure to use cookies, and salt/hash your passwords.

There's no submit button for the user sign up page so I can't test.
